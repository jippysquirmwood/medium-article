      <h1>Can we digitise the constrution phase faster?</h1>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="container text-justify">
    <p>In the recent past, and now more than ever, digitisation of the construction industry has become a major priority for tier 1 contractors and infrastructure owners. It is frequently discussed most industry forums and the Innovation Manager has become more important in the search for an edge. The benefits to productivity in our sector will be huge; those who make the jump will flourish and those who don't will cease to exist. We are all on this journey, but are we doing it as fast as we could be?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container text-justify">
    <p>The information flow at the execution phase of a construction project is vast and varied, and to the uninitiated the construction site and office can seem quite chaotic. But there are many core scenarios that vary little from project-to-project and construction professionals have managed these processes in an analogue way for centuries (with varying levels of patience).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container text-justify">
    <p>Digital transformation is happening, and construction site software is becoming ever more visible as we see site personnel capturing and assigning defects on tablets, or writing up their daily report in their smart phone. This is a great step forward for data capture and transparency, but these are examples of some pretty low hanging fruit. We are digitising from the bottom up, which is natural as we knock over the simple problems and graduate to the more challenging ones. But there are lots of examples of processes that are screaming out to be digitised now, for example:</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container text-justify">
    <h2>Quality Assurance</h2>
    <p>The progressive assurance of works through ITP and checklists, which is basically a list of steps, checks and hold points required to comply with the various standards and project specifications. These are gratuitously re-created by engineers from scratch on every project as if the work had never been performed before by anyone.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container text-justify">
    <h2>Occupational Health and Safety</h2>
    <p>Safety workflows such as inspections, hazard identification, incident reporting. We commonly see sites with a mailbox style object in which workers are encouraged to drop physical cards into (only for an administrator to plug in the data again at the end of the week or month). We forego the opportunity to get live site safety data and alerts for no good reason.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container text-justify">
    <h2>Risk Assessment and Method Statements</h2>
    <p>The communication of a safe sequence of work through Work Method Statements, which are generally comprised of very rigid, repetitive work sequences (e.g. dig trench, place bedding material, lay pipe, place haunching, backfill - excuse the simplification) usually only varied by environmental and interface considerations. The risk assessment is full of familiar things like "working at height" which come with the same controls every time. We forego the opportunity to re-use the rich learned information from previous scenarios and concentrate on what's different about this piece of work. We force the engineers to re-invent the wheel every time, in some cases delaying the commencement of an activity while we wait for the document to be written!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container text-justify">
    <p>These are just to name a few, but there are many more examples of execution phase workflows which are ripe to be digitised.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container text-justify">
    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>The execution phase has long been a period where disciplined processes go out the window, with the excuse that "no two projects are the same", but this attitude will not lead to improvements in productivity. There are many scenarios that are encountered in the same way on every project. If the industry can start to digitise these sooner and channel information end-to-end in a more structured way, the sooner we will reap the benefits of productivity of our engineers and site personnel, and learn from the rich untapped data that is out there being created every day.</p>
